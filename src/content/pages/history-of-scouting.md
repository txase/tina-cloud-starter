Scouting has been in America for a long time, but have you ever wondered how it came to America? It all started in London,1909, when an American businessman called William D. Boyce lost his way. A boy walked up and asked if he could help. Mr. Boyce told the boy where he wanted to go and the boy led him there. Mr. Boyce wanted to give the boy some money, but the boy said "No, thank you, sir. I am a Scout. I won't take anything for helping." 

On February 8, 1910, Mr. Boyce and a group of businessmen, educators, and political leaders founded the BSA. Today, Scouts celebrate that date as the birthday of the BSA.

No one knows what happened to tho boy who helped Mr. Boyce through London, but he will never be forgotten. In helping to bring Scouting to America, his good deed has been multiplied millions of times over as scouts have followed his example
